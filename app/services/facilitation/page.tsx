      <Typography paragraph>
        To help researchers effectively utilize computing resources, our Research
        Computing Facilitators (RCFs) not only guide the implementation of
        computational work on PATh-supported compute capacity, but can also point
        researchers to other national services related to research computing and
        data needs.

      <Typography paragraph>
        Drawing upon the principles of Research Computing Facilitation (RCF)
        pioneered by UW-Madison&rsquo;s Center for High Throughput Computing, the
        Facilitation Services team work to expand the impact of dHTC and dHTC
        Facilitation across various PATh stakeholders. These principles include:
      </Typography>
      <ul>
        <li>proactive engagement</li>
        <li>personalized guidance</li>
        <li>technology agnosticism</li>
        <li>
          &lsquo;teach-to-fish&rsquo; documentation and training methodologies
        </li>
        <li>prioritization of &ldquo;research performance&rdquo; over computing performance</li>
        <li>advocacy for user-centric improvements to relevant technologies.</li>
      </ul>
      <Typography paragraph>
        PATh Research Computing Facilitators apply these principles to the
        practice of dHTC Facilitation for researchers, research groups, and
        multi-institutional collaborations leveraging the dHTC environment of the
        OSG via access services like the{' '}
        <Link href='https://portal.osg-htc.org'>OSG Portal</Link>. For example,
        all new users of the OSG-Operated Access Points first meet with a
        Facilitator to collaborate on an efficient on-ramp plan.

        Facilitation for Campuses
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Leveraging the same principles and a history of experience with
        researchers, the RCF team also facilitates the navigation of PATh
        services for staff at campuses (including NSF CC* awardees) and other
        organizations looking to enhance their dHTC capabilities, whether by
        growing local dHTC capacity and support, or by connecting local resources
        and end-users into the OSG.

      <Typography variant='h5' component='h3' gutterBottom>
        Taking dHTC Impact Farther
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        As an ultimate principle of Research Computing Facilitation, insights from
        the facilitation of dHTC stakeholders are continually integrated across
        PATh areas to improve dHTC capabilities and services, including PATh&rsquo;s
        various outreach, education, and training programs.
