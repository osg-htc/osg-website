        All User Training sessions are offered on Tuesdays from 2:30–4pm ET
        (11:30am – 1pm PT), on the third Tuesday of the month. The trainings are
        designed as stand-alone subjects — you do not need to bring a dataset.
        The only prerequisites are some familiarity with the command line; some
        familiarity with HTCondor job submission is useful but not required.
