          The “origin” service connects the backend object store (a POSIX
          filesystem, S3-compatible endpoint, or HTTP endpoint) with the national
          infrastructure. The origin service needs access to the storage and
          incoming connectivity from the external infrastructure.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Most origin backends are currently a mounted shared filesystem, and S3
          endpoints like those found on AWS or{' '}
          <Link href='https://www.openstoragenetwork.org/'>OSN</Link> are
          increasingly common. To ease operations, the OSG Consortium offers a
          “hosted origin service” where central experts will install and operate
          the origin as a container, often deployed via the{' '}

    a: (

        <Typography paragraph>
          The OSDF enables users and institutions to make datasets available to
          compute jobs running in distributed high-throughput computing (dHTC)
          environments such as the <Link href='/services/ospool'>OSPool</Link>.
          Compute jobs submitted from an HTCondor access point can access data
          stored in data origins, with HTCondor managing data transfer via the
          OSDF’s global namespace and data caches.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          By providing the distributed data access layer via these data caches,
          jobs can reduce wide-area network consumption, load on the data
          origins, and latency of data access.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The OSDF is not limited to dHTC environments: it can be accessed via a
          browser (like S3, OSDF’s underlying protocol is HTTPS) or directly via
          a <Link href='https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelicanfs'>Python client</Link>.

        <Typography paragraph>
          The OSDF can be used in a variety of scenarios, including:
        </Typography>
        <ul>
          <li>A repository wants to stream its datasets, at scale, without scaling egress.</li>
          <li>
            A researcher wants to share a dataset with their community so others
            can use it in computational workflows.
          </li>
          <li>
            A researcher produces data on the OSPool that they need to store for
            future processing or sharing with the community.
          </li>
          <li>
            A team wants to make their datasets available to their community
            without opening their storage directly to the Internet.

        <Typography paragraph>
          Each origin is configured to enforce the object store’s access
          policies. Objects can be made public or private, and the repository
          controls the rules for sharing.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          The content distribution network enforces the origin’s access policies
          by requiring a signed{' '}

          objects.

        <Typography>
          Non-public data is encrypted when sent over the network, but not on
          disk. The OSDF is appropriate for non-public data from “open science”
          communities but not highly regulated or sensitive data (such as PII or
          HIPAA data).

      <Typography paragraph>
        The Open Science Data Federation (OSDF) connects disparate dataset
        repositories into a single, nation-wide data distribution network.
        Leveraging the OSDF, providers can make their datasets available to a
        wide variety of compute users, from browsers to Jupyter notebooks to high
        throughput computing environments.
      </Typography>
