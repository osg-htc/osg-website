          Running AlphaFold3 at scale can be challenging because jobs often spend
          a long time preparing inputs before structure prediction begins,
          including searching large reference databases to build alignments. The
          AlphaFold3 Alignment Library helps reduce this repeated work by allowing
          compatible OSPool workflows to reuse precomputed alignments when they
          are already available.

          What is the AlphaFold3 Alignment Library?
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The AlphaFold3 Alignment Library is a shared index and OSDF namespace
          for precomputed multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) that can be reused
          by cache-aware AlphaFold3 workflows running on the OSPool. The initial
          focus is protein-chain unpaired MSAs in A3M format, which are the
          alignment artifacts most useful for skipping repeated CPU-heavy sequence
          search work before GPU inference.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Each record links a normalized protein sequence hash to an alignment
          file, its OSDF/Pelican location, checksum, source, size, sequence count,
          and provenance metadata about how the alignment was generated.

          Why cache alignments?
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          AlphaFold3 workflows often spend substantial CPU time in the data
          pipeline searching large sequence databases to build MSAs. The alignment
          library reduces duplicated work by allowing those precomputed alignments
          to be reused when the sequence, source, and provenance are appropriate
          for the user&rsquo;s workflow.
        </Typography>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Faster cache-aware runs</strong> — jobs that find an acceptable
            cached MSA can skip part or all of the repeated sequence-search stage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower CPU and storage pressure</strong> — repeated database
            searches are replaced with OSDF/Pelican reads of smaller artifacts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reproducibility and provenance</strong> — cached records
            include source and checksum metadata.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community reuse</strong> — every validated contribution can
            make later structure-prediction workflows faster for researchers.
          </li>

          How can I contribute alignments?
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Contributing to the library is as easy as running AlphaFold3 using the
          OSG-provided workflow on your own sequences. Caching of alignments
          happens automatically when you run the workflow on the OSPool, and your
          generated alignments will be added to the library&rsquo;s registry and
          made available for reuse.
