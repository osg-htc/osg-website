      <Typography paragraph>
        OSG is helping to organize extra resources to be made available to
        COVID-19 research! These resources include:
      </Typography>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Capabilities for a variety of computational research tasks.</strong>{' '}
          See <Link href='/services/ospool'>Computation on the OSPool</Link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proactive consultation and facilitation</strong> for quickly
          scaling up and automating workloads with up to thousands of
          concurrently-running jobs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access to significant computing capacity</strong> through the{' '}
          <em>
            <Link href='https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home'>OSG Connect</Link>
          </em>{' '}
          service, which provides a batch system submit environment based on
          HTCondor. The OSG aggregates more than 100 clusters across the US, and
          COVID-19 projects have concurrently accessed tens of thousands of cores
          through this mechanism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expertise</strong> for maximizing research throughput, including
          help with workflow design and development.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Typography paragraph>
        COVID-19 researchers can access OSG through the Open Science Pool (e.g.,
        the &ldquo;<code>osg</code> VO&rdquo;), whether via the{' '}
        <Link href='https://connect.osg-htc.org/'>OSG Connect service</Link>, or by
        coordinating with us to route work from other submission points.

      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Any computing resource provider supporting the <code>osg</code> VO
        (&ldquo;Open Science Pool&rdquo;, see above) is likely already providing
        hours to support COVID-19. If you would like to provide additional
        resources <em>exclusive</em> for COVID-19,{' '}
